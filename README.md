# CyberVal-Injector

CyberVal is a paste of a internal Valorant Cheat which has been used by several providers like **LeagueHell**, **Enduty** and several other pasted chairs.
This is the Injector for my other repo.

## Information
This code is absolute trash, and likely will need some fixxing. (its shit)

## Installation

If you don't know how to inject, dont try it.

## Credits
Credits go to: all turkish/spanish pasters and to **zeroday-z** for fixxing the source and leaking it.
